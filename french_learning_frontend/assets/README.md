This directory holds app assets (images, JSON, etc.).

Environment files:
- Do not commit secrets. Place environment variables in a local .env file if needed for development.
- Provide a template in .env.example for reference.

Note: The Flutter app does not load .env from assets at runtime unless explicitly coded. Keep this directory for non-secret assets only.
